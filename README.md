# Dwolla Software Engineering Intern Technical Assessment

Thank you for applying to be one of our interns this summer! You've made it past the initial resume screen and now we want to see what you can do!

Please complete this technical assessment as outlined below. The assessment is not timeboxed, but we've scoped it to a couple hours or less. Please complete it within 3 days and email a link to your solution to [cfinholt@dwolla.com & jgens@dwolla.com](mailto:cfinholt@dwolla.com,jgens@dwolla.com) for review

## Scenario

You are to build out a page that lists all existing customers in a table and a dialog that can be used to add a new customer to that list. Please try to match the following mock-ups as closely as possible

### List

Recommended MUI Component: [Table](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-table/)
![List Mock-up](/mocks/list.png)

### Dialog

Recommended MUI Component: [Dialog](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-dialog/)
![Dialog Mock-up](/mocks/dialog.png)

## Additional Instructions

- Your starting point should be `src/pages/index.tsx`, which already provides a basic structure and an API call to get the list of customers
- API endpoints have been provided, which should be used for getting the list of customers and adding new ones. You can reference `src/pages/api/customers.ts` for details, but you should not have to make changes to that file as part of this exercise
- Use [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/all-components/) components
- Use of [Material UI's sx prop](https://mui.com/system/getting-started/the-sx-prop/) for styling is encouraged, but not required
- You are welcome to use AI tools to assist you (we do!), but please be prepared to explain your design choices and the code that you submit in a follow-up interview with the hiring manager
